  <p>The avocado (Persea americana) is a medium-sized, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen">evergreen</a> tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> more than 5,000 years ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_era">Then</a> as now it was prized for its large and unusually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado_oil">oily fruit</a>.[3] The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.[4][5][6] Its fruit, sometimes also referred to as an alligator pear or avocado pear, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.[7] Avocado trees are partly self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain consistent fruit output.[8] Avocados are presently cultivated in the tropical and Mediterranean climates of many countries.[4] Mexico is the world's leading producer of avocados as of 2020, supplying nearly 30% of the global harvest in that year.[9]</p>

  <p>Panicles of flowers with deciduous bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves. The tree flowers thousands of blossoms every year. Avocado blossoms sprout from racemes near the leaf axils; they are small and inconspicuous 5–10 mm (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) wide. They have no petals but instead 2 whorls of 3 pale-green or greenish-yellow downy perianth lobes, each blossom has 9 stamens with 2 basal orange nectar glands.[18][4]</p>
